# usbMcuProg
Little adapter board to connect PIC or SWD (2-wire, no SWO) programming signals over Micro USB D+/D-/ID pins.  
The idea is a target that already uses a Micro B connector (for power, or even interface) could be debugged by connecting the debugging signals over the existing connector, preventing the need for an auxiliary debug header.
